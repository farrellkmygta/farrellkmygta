 1. Uploading a Flipbook to Your Website
Uploading the Flipbook is just a matter of connecting to your website, creating a directory and placing all the files from the zip file into this directory. We’ll go through this process step-by-step:
1.1 Get a FTP Client
First of all you must have a FTP client in order to upload your files. Any FTP client will work but we recommend Filezilla if you haven’t got a FTP client yet: http://filezilla-project.org/download.php
Filezilla is 100% free (it’s open source) but it’s a great FTP client.
1.2 Connecting to Your Website
Connecting to your website is quite easy but you have to have the right FTP information. If you don’t know what your FTP information is, please contact your webmaster or your hosting company.
1.2.1 Fill in the hosting information
When you start Filezilla, look for the “quickconnect“ button in the top of the screen like you see below. This is where you need to put in your FTP information.
There are 3 variables you’ll need to have: - Host
- Username
- Password

1.2.2 Connecting
Once you filled in your FTP information, click on “Quickconnect” and Filezilla will connect to your website for you. You will see the following screen if your FTP information was right:
The left side of the screen is your local computer. On the right side you find the files on your website’s server.Thenextstepistonavigatetotherootofthewebsite.Inthiscaseit’sthefoldercalled“public_ html“. Simply double click on it and it will show you the files on your website.
1.3 Uploading Your Flipbook Files
Now you’re connected, lets start transferring the files from our local computer to the website. As you can see in the below graphic, I’m in the directory that contains the extracted flipbook on the left, and on the right it’s the website folder of where I want to have the flipbook:

Just right-click on the folder on the left and choose“upload“ and it will start transferring all the files to your website. This can take a while, depending on how large your flipbook is.
Once it’s finished uploading, you can right click on the folder on the right and choose “Rename“ to give it a different name like for example “flipbook“.

To access your flipbook, open up your browser and type in your domain, followed by the name of the directory you just renamed. For example: http://www.yourdomain.com/flipbook/
2. How to Get a Simple Embed Code for Your Flipbook
We recommend to open the flipbook in a new window instead of embedding it within a page. This way it will use the whole browser screen which provides the best quality and experience. However, some of our users prefer to embed it inside an existing page.
Embedding is very simple if you have a static website, you can simply use the exact code that is used inside index.html - however some of our users can’t add javascripts to the header of the page for example because they use CMS systems like Wordpress, Joomla or custom coded.
In such a case you’ll just need a simple embed code to place it on your website. Use the generator on this page to create a simple embed code of a few lines: http://www.instantflipbook.com/blog/flip-book-embed-code-generator.html
Once you’ve generated a code with the above generator, simply copy paste it anywhere on your website where the flipbook should show up.
3. Using the Flipbook on Offline Media
If you want to use the flipbook on offline media like CD’s/DVD’s/Local Desktop or USB Flash Drives, all you have to do is open up index.html in your browser.
Please follow these steps:
1. Extract your flipbook zip file that you’ve downloaded from your account. 2. This will produce a folder called “flipbook”
3. Copy the “flipbook”-folder to the CD/DVD/USB stick.
Now all you have to do is open“index.html”inside the“flipbook”-folder and it will show your flipbook inside your browser.
